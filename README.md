# Kibir ECS
Basically an excuse to reinvent the wheel.

## What it is
Just another your run of the mill ECS implementation. However this is not a "framework" for game
development, it's merely an architectural scaffolding which hopefully will be the foundation of a
game engine in the future..

## Implementation
At this point in time I'm only dipping my toe in both ECS and C++ so this is not using any over
the top, compile-time-only, hyper-performant, template-voodoo-meta-programming mumbo jumbo. It is 
close to what I'd consider the simplest ~~working~~ implementation of ECS.

## The future
It might or might not stay this way. I intend to flesh this out to be nice to use in a game engine
at the very least. I suspect KibirECS to change once I actually start the game engine itself. For 
the time being preformance is not the most concerning part, although being cache friendly and 
actually learning what that means is one of my goals. 

It might just so happen that I turn to the Dark side of C++ that is template meta programming and 
this ends up being one of many template only ECS implementations. *Admittedly templates are pretty 
cool...*
